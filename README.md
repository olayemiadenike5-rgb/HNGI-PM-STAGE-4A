# Finora (Smart Money Management System)

## What Finora Does
Finora is a smart money management system that helps users plan, track, and prioritize their spending using real-time account data.  
Instead of budgeting based on guesses, Finora connects to your bank account and organizes your monthly expenses by priority — ensuring essentials come first.

It doesn’t just show where your money goes. it helps you make smarter financial decisions.
